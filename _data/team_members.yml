  bio: My name is Anup Kumar Ram and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Aramburu lab. I completed my PhD from National Institute of Science Education and Research (India), where I studied how compromised protein translation initiation fidelity affects cellular physiology using proteomics, riboseq, genetics, biochemistry and imaging. Since I joined the Aramburu lab in February 2025, I have been working on identifying sORF encoded microproteins during infection and exploring their molecular function. Being a researcher, what excites me the most is to know the unkown. Outside lab, I love music, poetry, cricket, cooking and going to mountains.
